# Moving-a-circle-across-the-canvas

The application displays one window in which there are two squares and a circle.
When you click on the left square, the circle moves towards the right square by an arbitrary number of pixels.
When you click on the right square, the circle returns to its original position.
When the circle reaches either side of the right square or its center, the circle returns to its original position with animation.
